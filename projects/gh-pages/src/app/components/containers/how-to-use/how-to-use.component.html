  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <section>
    <p>For using the features this library provides are two main approaches you can choose from, "Model-Driven" and
      "Template-Driven", each of them have their own characteristics and strengths is up to the developer to choose one
      or in some cases use a mix of both. We recommend analysing the use case and see which suits better for it. They both are
      explained in more details in the next sections.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Model-Driven</h2>

  <section>
    <p>The model-driven approach provides a way of defining a model which later will be bind to a form or UI components
      in the template and it will keep track of the changes of the states(values). It provides direct, explicit
      access to the underlying object model in a synchronous way and compared with the Template-Driven approach is
      way more robust, scalable, reusable, flexible and gives more control over the model.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Template-Driven</h2>

  <section>
    <p> This method is used to bing specific ui components to Qps without the need of creating a model(Ui2QpGroup) and
      Ui2QpRoot. It relies on directives in the template to manipulate and synchronize the component's state to the Qp
      defined.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Choosing an approach</h2>

  <section>
    <p>Choosing an approach will always depends of each specific use case, but we've learnt that are some conditions
      that can help to decide which could be the approach to use. Think if the use case fill some of these
      conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Few ui components</li>
      <li>The components have no relation between them</li>
      <li>Almost none or not manipulation is required for the state of the components</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the previous conditions are filled for a use case then probably the Template-Driven is the right approach,
      if not, Model-Driven is the way to go. When not sure in which one to choose go with Model-Driven approach is
      our recommendation</p>
